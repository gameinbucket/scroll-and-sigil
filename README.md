## todo

[] production should cache files on server
[] allow config files for creating things/scenery/items/missiles (instead of hard coded)
[] server should perform analysis of map to determine what blocks are visible from a given block, and cull network traffic per person
  the same logic should be applicable for view culling for client rendering
  cast rays from edges of cube/blocks and determine if "solid" block prevents view
[] camera will zoom to avoid clipping terrain
[] client side movement prediction/reckoning
[] chatbox for people to talk
[] motion blur shader
[] anti aliasing shader
[] ambient occlusion shader
[] depth of field shader
